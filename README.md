# Awesome Embodied AI

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of world models, VLAs, and foundation models for robotics and embodied AI.

## Auto-Updated Paper Feeds

This repo automatically pulls new papers from arXiv twice daily (8am & 6pm UTC) covering:

- **[World Models Papers](digests/world_models.md)** - Papers matching "world model" and "world models"
- **[VLA Papers](digests/vla.md)** - Papers matching "VLA", "vision language action", and "vision-language-action"

Each feed shows papers from the last 2 days, with papers that have project pages or code highlighted at the top. Want to run this yourself? See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
