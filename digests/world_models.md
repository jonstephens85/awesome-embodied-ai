**Published:** 2026-01-27 | **Categories:** cs.AI

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19834v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19834v1.pdf) | [Project Page](https://thuml.github.io/Reasoning-Visual-World)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind...

**Authors:** Zhao-Han Peng, Shaohui Li, Zhi Li, Shulan Ruan, Yu Liu et al. (6 authors)

**Published:** 2026-01-27 | **Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAW...

### [HARMONI: Multimodal Personalization of Multi-User Human-Robot Interactions with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19839v1)

**Authors:** Jeanne Malécot, Hamed Rahimi, Jeanne Cattoni, Marie Samson, Mouad Abrini et al. (8 authors)

**Published:** 2026-01-27 | **Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.HC

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Existing human-robot interaction systems often lack mechanisms for sustained personalization and dynamic adaptation in multi-user environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal ...

### [Agentic Design Patterns: A System-Theoretic Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19752v1)

**Authors:** Minh-Dung Dao, Quy Minh Le, Hoang Thanh Lam, Duc-Trong Le, Quoc-Viet Pham et al. (7 authors)

**Published:** 2026-01-27 | **Categories:** cs.AI

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19752v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19752v1.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introdu...

### [Dynamic Worlds, Dynamic Humans: Generating Virtual Human-Scene Interaction Motion in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19484v1)

**Authors:** Yin Wang, Zhiying Leng, Haitian Liu, Frederick W. B. Li, Mu Li et al. (6 authors)

**Published:** 2026-01-27 | **Categories:** cs.CV

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives change...

### [LLMs versus the Halting Problem: Revisiting Program Termination Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18987v1)

**Authors:** Oren Sultan, Jordi Armengol-Estape, Pascal Kesseli, Julien Vanegue, Dafna Shahaf et al. (7 authors)

**Published:** 2026-01-26 | **Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.PL

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18987v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18987v1.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent succe...

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Building world models is essential for planning in real-world domains such as businesses. Since such domains have rich semantics, we can leverage world knowledge to effectively model complex action effects and causal relationships from limited data. In this work, we propose CASSANDRA, a neurosymbolic world modeling approach that leverages an LLM as a knowledge prior to construct lightweight transition models for planning. CASSANDRA integrates two components: (1) LLM-synthesized code to model det...

<summary>Abstract</summary>

The vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm has enabled powerful robotic control by leveraging vision-language models, but its reliance on large-scale, high-quality robot data limits its generalization. Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions. To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajector...

### [Beyond Static Datasets: Robust Offline Policy Optimization via Vetted Synthetic Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18107v1)

**Authors:** Pedram Agand, Mo Chen

**Published:** 2026-01-26 | **Categories:** cs.LG, cs.HC, cs.RO

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18107v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18107v1.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) holds immense promise for safety-critical domains like industrial robotics, where real-time environmental interaction is often prohibitive. A primary obstacle in ORL remains the distributional shift between the static dataset and the learned policy, which typically mandates high degrees of conservatism that can restrain potential policy improvements. We present MoReBRAC, a model-based framework that addresses this limitation through Uncertainty-Aware latent s...
