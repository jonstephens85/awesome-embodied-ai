### [Verification of the Implicit World Model in a Generative Model via Adversarial Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05903v1)

**Authors:** András Balogh, Márk Jelasity

**Published:** 2026-02-05 | **Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05903v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05903v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/szegedai/world-model-verification)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify ...

### [PIRATR: Parametric Object Inference for Robotic Applications with Transformers in 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05557v1)

**Authors:** Michael Schwingshackl, Fabio F. Oberweger, Mario Niedermeyer, Huemer Johannes, Markus Murschitz

**Published:** 2026-02-05 | **Categories:** cs.CV, cs.RO

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05557v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05557v1.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/swingaxe/piratr)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adj...

### [Visuo-Tactile World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06001v1)

**Authors:** Carolina Higuera, Sergio Arnaud, Byron Boots, Mustafa Mukadam, Francois Robert Hogan et al. (6 authors)

**Published:** 2026-02-05 | **Categories:** cs.RO

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06001v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06001v1.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

We introduce multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM), which capture the physics of contact through touch reasoning. By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves ...

### [Safe Urban Traffic Control via Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Prediction and World-Model Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04821v1)

**Authors:** Joydeep Chandra, Satyam Kumar Navneet, Aleksandr Algazinov, Yong Zhang

**Published:** 2026-02-04 | **Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04821v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04821v1.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guaran...

### [Dual Mind World Model Inspired Network Digital Twin for Access Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04566v1)

**Authors:** Hrishikesh Dutta, Roberto Minerva, Noel Crespi

**Published:** 2026-02-04 | **Categories:** cs.NI, cs.AI, cs.MA

**Links:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04566v1) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04566v1.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Emerging networked systems such as industrial IoT and real-time cyber-physical infrastructures demand intelligent scheduling strategies capable of adapting to dynamic traffic, deadlines, and interference constraints. In this work, we present a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework inspired by Dual Mind World Model (DMWM) architecture, for learning-informed and imagination-driven network control. Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines s...

### [Language Models Struggle to Use Representations Learned In-Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04212v1)

**Authors:** Michael A. Lepori, Tal Linzen, Ann Yuan, Katja Filippova

**Published:** 2026-02-04 | **Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, ...
